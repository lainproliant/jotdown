### Example
- A silly list.
- Ends here.


1. First item.
    a. First item.
    b. Second item.
    c. Third item.
2. Second item.
    - This is an unordered list inside the second item.
        999. This is a new ordered list.
        1000. The numbers can start anywere.
        1. They don't have to be in order.
    - This is a weird example.
        alpha. They can even be @words.
        beta. Though the grammer #suggests they must be in order, they don't have to be.
        omega. These just @happen[oranges] to #be.

An ordered list is just like an unordered list, but each list element has a label.  These labels
don't have to be in order, but they must be unique.
